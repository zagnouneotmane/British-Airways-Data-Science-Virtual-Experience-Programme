# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme
Welcome to the British Airways Data Science virtual experience programme, Otmane! This programme consists of two tasks that will help you gain insights into customer review data and predict customer buying behaviour.

## Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights
In this task, you will use web scraping techniques to extract and analyze customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways. You will use Python to scrape the data, manipulate it, and create a PowerPoint presentation to showcase your findings.

Skills required: Web Scraping, Data Manipulation, PowerPoint, Python

## Task 2: Predicting customer buying behaviour
In this task, you will build a predictive model to understand the factors that influence buying behaviour among British Airways customers. You will use Python to clean and preprocess the data, build a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

Skills required: Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning, Python

Although you can complete the tasks in any order, we recommend completing them in chronological order, as they build on one another. Good luck and have fun!
